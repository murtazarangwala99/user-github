# Github User Landing Page

## Notes:

- I try to do it with `GitHub REST API documentation` but i go with non-authentication way which is directly fething from user-URL Api.

- I also try to build `pagination` but i am unable to do this at this moment, because i am not using pure Js from so long, i am learning and builing just on reactJs, it's challenging for me to do this in One day also.

- I am recovering from my accident, so i haven't done much in Js from last 1 year.

- Feel good to work and sharping my Js after long time, will definetely work more towards it.

- I tried to make it basic and simple.

- Will definitely want to listen back from you guys, feedback or anything...
